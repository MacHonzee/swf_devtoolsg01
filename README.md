This npm library is built for UAF framework Node.js applications
and its main capability is comparing implementation and documentation.

In the future, it will be able to create commands from uuShapes templates,
or create commands as defined in uuAppModelKit.

There are several restrictions to both implementation and documentation:

## Implementation
1. It must be an uuApp with server in Node.js, client and library is not 
supported currently.
2. TODO

## Documentation
1. The documentation must be done in uuBookKit with plugged in uuAppModelKit.
2. TODO
